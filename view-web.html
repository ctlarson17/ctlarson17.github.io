            <h1>Web Design Experience</h1>
            
            <p>A vast majority of my design experience has been focused on creating online user experiences for people on computers. 
                <br>
                The following work examples are just a few projects that I have been a part of. 
            </p>

            <h2>Supply Chain Risk Analysis Tool</h2>
            
            <!-- Contextual Text -->
            <p>One of the first big projects I worked on was a tool which assisted supply chain risk analysis. 
                This was a huge project with many features. A serious challenge for this project was the logically and intuitvely laying out an immense volumn of data. 
            </p>
            
            <img src="Web A1.png" alt="Supply Chain Risk Analysis 1" class="example-image">

            <p>This page shows a personnel profile page. The user would come here perform a risk analysis on the leaders in a company.</p>
        
            <img src="Web A2.png" alt="Supply Chain Risk Analysis 2" class="example-image">

            <p>This page shows the timeline of a microelectronic part.  These timelines could get very tricky, as companies would buy and sell part IP from each other in addition to making changes to the part itself over its lifetime. Each time a change is made to a part, its manufacturer must issue a notification to all consumers of that part.  This tool was intended to quickly visualize the history of a part, and quickly navigate to any occurances which indicate a higher risk profile.</p>

            <h2>Guided Badge Builder</h2>
            
            <!-- Contextual Text -->
            <p>This project is one I worked on when I started at RainFocus. Their existing badge building solution relied heavily on knowing Html, CSS, and Javascript. We needed to find a way to help users easily build badge templates for their events. 
            The guided badge builder is what we came up with.   
            </p>
            
            <img src="Web B1.png" alt="Guided Badge Builder 1" class="example-image">

            <p>This fist page shows the mapping process. Often times our clients want to map certain images to their badges depending on an attribute value. This allows users to upload a unique background image for each value of their selected attribute.</p>
        
            <img src="Web B2.png" alt="Guided Badge Builder 2" class="example-image">

            <p>Once backgrounds are mapped, the user gets to set up their content. There is always a fine line between flexibilty and control, and I think we stuck it perfectly with this one.  We give the user a 9-point grid to place the content of their badge on.  Each line of the "cluster" can receive its own custom styling, allowing for any combination of font and color the user may want.</p>
